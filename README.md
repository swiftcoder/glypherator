# Glypherator

Simple procedural glyphs rendered in an html5 canvas.

* Add ?<number> to the URL to set a particular seed value.
* Add #gif to the URL to render the glyph to a gif.

For the moment this is a state machine driven by pseudo-random choices (i.e. quick and dirty). Later on it should probably explore more nuanced generation techniques.
